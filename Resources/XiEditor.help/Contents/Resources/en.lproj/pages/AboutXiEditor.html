        <h1>About Xi-Editor</h1>
        <i>(pronounced "Zigh")</i><br />
        <p>
        The xi editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor, using modern software engineering
        techniques. It is initially built for Mac OS X, using Cocoa for the user interface. There are also frontends for
        other operating systems available from third-party developers.
        </p>

        <p>Goals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong><em>Incredibly high performance</em></strong>. All editing operations should commit and paint
                in under 16ms. The editor should never make you wait for anything.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong><em>Beauty</em></strong>. The editor should fit well on a modern desktop, and not look like a
                throwback from the &apos;80s or &apos;90s. Text drawing should be done with the best
                technology available (Core Text on Mac, DirectWrite on Windows, etc.), and
                support Unicode fully.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong><em>Reliability</em></strong>. Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong><em>Developer friendliness</em></strong>. It should be easy to customize xi editor, whether
                by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.</p></li>
        </ul>
